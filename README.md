# Codecrafters Shell in C

A simple, Unix-like terminal shell written in C that demonstrates robust process management, command parsing, and system-level programming. This project is designed to showcase fundamental operating system concepts and low-level programming skillsâ€”making it an ideal example for both academic research and industry evaluation.

## Features

- **Command Parsing & Execution**: Interprets user input and executes built-in or system commands.
- **Process Management**: Demonstrates creation and management of child processes using system calls.
- **I/O Redirection & Piping**: Implements basic input/output redirection and piping to chain commands.
- **Background Execution**: Supports executing processes in the background.
- **Modular & Extensible Design**: Clean code structure designed for easy expansion and maintenance.

## Why This Project?

- Explore practical implementations of OS concepts like process control, inter-process communication, and command-line parsing in a concise and readable codebase.
- Evaluate hands-on experience with C programming, system-level programming, and problem-solving in a real-world-like project. This shell project is a testament to strong foundational skills in computer science and software engineering.

## Installation
**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oberynnn/codecrafters-shell-c.git
   cd codecrafters-shell-c
   ```
Compile the Shell
```bash
gcc -o shell main.c
```

Alternatively, compile manually:
```bash
gcc -o shell main.c
```
Run the Shell
``` bash
./shell
```
## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can execute standard commands, use I/O redirection, and run processes in the background. The shell provides a simple interface that mimics common Unix terminal behavior.
